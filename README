NAME
    Hook::Heckle - create pre and post hooks

DESCRIPTION
    Creating hooks to subroutines is issued by many other cpan modules. See

    *   the Class::Hook manpage

    *   the Hook::Scope manpage

    *   the Hook::WrapSub manpage

    *   the Hook::LexWrap manpage

    *   the Hook::PrePostCall manpage

    But this didnt kept me from writing a new one. It is a base class and
    can be inherited.
